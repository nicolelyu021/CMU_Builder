## 🎤 Presentation Script (2 min per feature)

### Opening (30 sec)
"Fit-Tartans is an AI-powered fitness scheduler that combines your Google Calendar with fitness classes from Eventbrite and CMU GroupX. Let me show you the top 3 features that make this special."

### Feature 1: Dashboard (1.5 min)
"As soon as you combine your data, you get a comprehensive dashboard. Here you can see at a glance: total events, how many are fitness classes, how many are existing calendar commitments, and most importantly - how many free hours you have available. This gives you instant insight into your schedule."

### Feature 2: Visual Timeline (2 min)
"Next, we have an interactive visual timeline - this is a Gantt chart showing all your events. You can see calendar events in blue and fitness classes in red. Hover over any event for details. We also have a heatmap showing when you're busiest throughout the week, and a breakdown of class types. This visual representation makes it easy to see your schedule at a glance."

### Feature 3: AI Recommendations (2.5 min)
"Finally, our AI-powered recommendation engine. You set your preferences - preferred times, days, max classes per week. Then our algorithm scores every fitness class based on how well it fits your schedule and preferences. It checks for conflicts with your existing calendar, considers your time preferences, and gives you a match score out of 100. Here are the top recommendations - notice how they all fit perfectly in your free time slots and match your preferences. We also provide insights like your busiest day and most common class type."

### Closing (30 sec)
